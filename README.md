### Summary

The Liberty App Accelerator provides a starting point for creating applications running on [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/).

To deploy this application to Bluemix using a toolchain click the **Create Toolchain** button.
[![Create Toolchain](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/)

### Requirements
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)

### Configuration
The application is configured to provide various technologies and features. These capabilities are provided through dependencies in the build.gradle file and Liberty features enabled in the server config file found in `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`.

### Project contents
The context root is set in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` file. The ports are set in the build.gradle file.     

* **Springboot** : Inside the project there is a application.springboot.web package containing two classes:
    * `SpringBootLibertyApplication`: The entry point for the SpringBoot application.
    * `LibertyHelloController`: A Spring REST endpoint which you can access at `http://localhost:9080/<context>/springbootweb`

There is also a test class named `it.springboot.web.HelloControllerTest` that will test the Spring REST endpoint to ensure it is working.    

The project contains Bluemix specific files that are used to deploy the application as part of a Bluemix DevOps flow. The `.bluemix` directory contains files used to define the Bluemix toolchain and pipeline for your application. The `manifest.yml` file specifies the name of your application in Bluemix, the timeout value during deployment and which services to bind to.

### Run

To build and run the application:
1. `gradle build`
1. `gradle libertyStart`
1. To stop the application run `gradle libertyStop` 

To deploy the application to bluemix:
1. `gradle build cfPush -PcfOrg=[your email address] -PcfUsername=[your username] -PcfPassword=[your password]`

The application will be deployed to the following url: [http://LibertyProject.mybluemix.net/LibertyProject/]
